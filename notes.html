 <h2> Notes </h2>   
    
    <ul>
        <li> We use pokeApi for all the data</li>
        <li> Note that you must delets /pokedex from the url in index for it to work outside of github</li>
        <li>Information: We have provided three ways to see information. In index we provided an easy way to see the pokedex information and upon a click we can        see the pokemon within the selected pokedex. Once clicked on the pokemon we can see information on the pokemon. We gather data for the pokemomn from        two different locations (note that for some pokemon some of the data does not exsist)</li>
        <li>CSS: Css is simple and makes all aspects easy to read. Colors compliment eachother and there is no cluttering. Looks Professional</li>
        <li>In total we gather data from 4 different places within the API (pokedexs, pokemon in pokedex, pokemon traits 1, pokemon traits 2)</li>
        <li>We use url objects to switch between index and pokeView. We pass along the data for the urls inside the pokedexs to the next page.</li>
        <li>We added a search bar that filters our data based on the letter chosen for the user to find his/her favorite pokemon.</li>
